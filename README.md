# Seeing with Hand aka ArchEyes

Seeing is chaotic, passive and private. It is also temporal and idiosyncratic. 

But can Seeing break free from one's interior? Can seeing be performative? 

Can the sharing of what we saw bypass the analytical organization and verbalization?

I'm hoping to create a kind of "performative seeing" - the act of observation or appreciation of forms becomes externalized through annotation. This process would create traces of one's cognitive engagement, which can be shared and analyzed.

The starting point of ArchEyes is to transform the experience of architectural observation through a 2d surface (e.g. looking at a black and white photograph of Villa Savoye or an illustration of the frontal view of Duomo Florence) from a passive, private act into a gestural,  annotative process that externalizes the viewer's visual/cognitive engagement with form.

the greater ambition for ArchEyes, is to explore 'Perceptual Signatures' - The unique patterns of attention in the context of 'formal appreciation', (enjoying the aesthetic pleasure of forms) -- the order of discovery, the durational weight given to different formal relationships - they constitute an "id" of that experience. *Could this kind of perceptual fingerprint reveal patterns in how different individuals construct aesthetic meaning?*
